# Resulting coin detections

Resulting detection boxes on the new coin images that were not part of train and test (validation) sets.

Due to absence of rings and pendants in the training and validation sets (also possibly partly due to the small size of the sets) these objects got detected as coins, as can be seen in the last image. Other than that coins get detected overall adequately in scenarios when they're discernible.
